# Load Library and Dataset

```{r load library, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

# Produce Visualizations
### Visualization with code
This first example is one that produces the visualization with the code because it doesn't have echo=FALSE after murders. 
```{r murders plot no code} 

murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb,rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
          geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
          coord_flip()
```

### Visualization without code
The addition of echo = FALSE prevents code from showing up on the presentation. 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb,rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
          geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
          coord_flip()
```
